## Introduction

This Shiny app allows you to interactively build and evaluate linear regression and decision tree models on selected datasets. This document provides instructions on how to use the app.

## Datasets

The app offers the following built-in datasets for model building:

*   **mtcars:** Motor Trend Car Road Tests (for linear regression)
*   **iris:** Iris Flower Dataset (for classification)
*   **Boston:** Boston Housing Dataset (for linear regression)

## Input Controls

The sidebar panel contains the following input controls:

*   **Select Dataset:** Choose the dataset you want to use for model building.
*   **Select Dependent Variable:** Select the outcome variable you want to predict. This dropdown updates based on the selected dataset.
*   **Select Independent Variables:** Select the predictor variables to include in the model. This list updates based on the selected dataset and dependent variable.
*   **Select Model Type:** Choose between "Linear Regression" and "Decision Tree".
*   **Train/Test Split (% Train):** Use the slider to determine the percentage of data to be used for training the model. The remaining data will be used for testing.

## Model Building Tab

This tab displays the results of the model building process.

### Model Summary

This section shows a summary of the fitted model.

*   **Linear Regression:** Includes coefficients, p-values, R-squared, and other relevant statistics.
*   **Decision Tree:** Displays the tree structure.

### Evaluation Metrics

This section presents a table of evaluation metrics calculated on the test set.

*   **Linear Regression:**
    *   **RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error):** A measure of the average prediction error.
    *   **R-squared:** Represents the proportion of variance in the dependent variable explained by the model.
    *   **MAE (Mean Absolute Error):** Another measure of average prediction error.
*   **Decision Tree:**
    *   **Accuracy:** The proportion of correctly classified instances.
    *   **Precision:** The proportion of true positives among the predicted positives.
    *   **Recall:** The proportion of true positives among the actual positives.
    *   **F1-score:** A balanced measure that considers both precision and recall.

### Diagnostic Plots

This section provides diagnostic plots to help you assess the model's assumptions and performance.

*   **Linear Regression:**
    *   **Residuals vs Fitted:** Checks for non-linearity and non-constant variance.
    *   **Normal Q-Q:** Assesses whether the residuals are normally distributed.
    *   **Scale-Location:** Checks for homoscedasticity (constant variance of residuals).
    *   **Residuals vs Leverage:** Identifies influential data points.
*   **Decision Tree:**
    *   **Decision Tree Plot:** Visualizes the decision tree structure.
    *   **Variable Importance:** Shows the relative importance of each predictor variable in the model.

## How to Use the App

1.  Select a dataset from the "Select Dataset" dropdown.
2.  Choose the dependent variable from the "Select Dependent Variable" dropdown.
3.  Select the independent variables using the checkboxes in "Select Independent Variables".
4.  Choose the desired model type ("Linear Regression" or "Decision Tree") using the radio buttons.
5.  Adjust the "Train/Test Split" slider to set the percentage of data for training.
6.  The app will automatically train the model and display the results in the "Model Building" tab.
7.  Examine the model summary, evaluation metrics, and diagnostic plots to assess the model's performance.
8.  You can change the inputs and rebuild the model as many times as needed.

## Cross Validation
During the model selection and training process, 10 fold cross validation is used. This provides a more reliable estimate of how well the model is likely to generalize.

## Notes

*   The app handles missing values by omitting them (using `na.omit()`).
*   The decision tree model uses the `rpart` package, and the tree is visualized using `rpart.plot`.
*   The `caret` package is used for model training, cross-validation, and evaluation metrics calculations.
