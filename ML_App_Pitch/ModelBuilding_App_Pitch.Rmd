## Slide 1: Introducing the App

**Unlocking Insights with Interactive Modeling**

<br>

A powerful Shiny app for building, evaluating, and understanding linear regression and decision tree models.

[Link to App](https://ml73o6-mohammed-teslim.shinyapps.io/machinelearning_app/) | [Link to GitHub Repository](https://github.com/Tescoh/Developing-Data-Product.git) - procced to the folder named MachineLearning App


## Slide 2: Problem & Solution

**The Challenge:**

*   Understanding and applying statistical models can be complex.
*   Traditional tools often lack interactivity and visual aids.

**Our Solution:**

*   An intuitive Shiny app that simplifies model building.
*   Interactive controls for dataset and variable selection.
*   Visualizations to aid in model interpretation and evaluation.

## Slide 3: App Features - Interactive Controls

``` {r, echo=FALSE, out.width="15%", fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("screenshot_input_controls.png")
```
**Explore Data & Build Models:**

*   Select from multiple datasets (`mtcars`, `iris`, `Boston`).
*   Choose dependent & independent variables.
*   Select model type (Linear Regression or Decision Tree).
*   Adjust train/test split.
*   Train models with 10-fold cross-validation.

## Slide 4: App Features - Results & Diagnostics

``` {r, echo=FALSE, out.width="15%", fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("screenshot_output_results.png")
```

**Understand & Evaluate:**

*   Detailed model summaries.
*   Key evaluation metrics (R-squared, RMSE, MAE, Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1).
*   Diagnostic plots for model assessment:
    *   Linear Regression: Residual plots, Q-Q plots.
    *   Decision Tree: Tree visualization, variable importance.
